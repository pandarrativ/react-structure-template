# REACT_STRUCTURE_TEMPLATE

## Description
Â In order to support different teams to work on their own project while maintaining frontend React code compatibility across teams, we setup a code base for developers to build their project on. This structure template is firstly created to support Learning-Oriented Narratives Creation subteams for future code combination. 

This structure template is based on Node20 (node=v20.11.1, npm=10.2.3)
To manage and change Node version, you may use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
